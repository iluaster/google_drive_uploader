=====================

Google Drive Uploader bash shell version

usage: ./quickstart.sh yourfile

This is my first github project.

Since my linux server OS is too old to install or run new language tool, 

I decide to write a uploader in shell language.

This shell script will run Netcat SLL(nssl), so you have to install it.

http://sourceforge.net/projects/nssl/
Download & Compile it with libssl.

In ubuntu or Debian, you can enter this command to install.
$ apt-get install libssl-dev

If you have any problem or suggestion, please contact me.
